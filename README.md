Machine Learning Sales Prediction – Demo Project
📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a demo machine learning pipeline for predicting numerical targets (e.g. sales, demand, revenue) using Python & Scikit-Learn.
⚠️ Important:
This is a demonstration version created to showcase coding style, ML workflow, and evaluation approach.
The full business-ready version is available upon request.
🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
Clean data loading & preprocessing
Handling missing values using imputation
Train / Test split
Training a Random Forest Regressor
Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
Production-style code structure
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.9+
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NumPy
📊 Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using industry-standard regression metrics:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
These metrics provide insight into prediction accuracy and error magnitude.
