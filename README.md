**Machine Learning Sales Prediction – Demo Project**

**📌 Project Overview**
This repository contains a **demo machine learning** pipeline for predicting numerical targets (e.g. sales, demand, revenue) using **Python & Scikit-Learn**.
**⚠️ Important:**
This is a **demonstration version** created to showcase coding style, ML workflow, and evaluation approach.
The **full business-ready version** is available upon request.

**🧠 What This Project Demonstrates**
Clean data loading & preprocessing
Handling missing values using imputation
Train / Test split
Training a **Random Forest Regressor**
Model evaluation using **MAE** and **RMSE**
Production-style code structure

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Python 3.9+
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NumPy

**📊 Evaluation Metrics**
The model is evaluated using industry-standard regression metrics:
**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
These metrics provide insight into prediction accuracy and error magnitude.
